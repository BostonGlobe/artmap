He served as an aide to Washington during the Revolutionary War, participated in the Continental Congress, signed the Constitution, and was appointed the first Secretary of the Treasury under President Washington. Most importantly, Hamilton helped to secure the future of the new United States by creating a unified economy and a national bank. As an advocate of strong federal government, Hamilton made more than a few enemies among his fellow politicians, including Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. Some ridiculed him as a monarchist, claiming that he intended to impose a strict, centralized rule on the American people. Among Hamilton’s many personal and political opponents was Vice President Aaron Burr. After challenging Hamilton to a duel, Burr killed him with a shot to the abdomen.This sculpture by William Rimmer shows Hamilton with cloth draped over his Colonial-era outfit. The heavy folds of drapery bring to mind depictions of Greek and Roman leaders in ancient statuary. Through this anachronistic touch, Rimmer evoked the first democratic-style governments in ancient Greece, thereby emphasizing Hamilton’s formative role in the newly emerging American democracy. Interestingly, Rimmer was a physician before devoting himself to art. He did not use a model to create the statue, but instead employed his unique knowledge of human anatomy to chisel Hamilton’s body from a block of granite. Due to Rimmer’s unusual technique, this sculpture is particularly fragile and difficult to maintain.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Commonwealth Ave., between Arlington St. and Berkeley St.","full_address":"Commonwealth Ave., between Arlington St. and Berkeley St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.072465,42.353434]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/AlexanderHamilton_long.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/18.%20Alexander%20Hamilton%20Statue%20-%202.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/AlexanderHamiltonStatue_long.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/AlexanderHamilton_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Granite","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"1865"},

Hutchinson’s beliefs differed in subtle yet significant ways from those of the colony’s Puritan majority. For example, she challenged the belief that women were born into a more sinful state than men, and she invited women to study the Bible on their own, without relying on the interpretations of male ministers. As a result, Hutchinson was banished for heresy in 1638 and fled to the area that would soon become Rhode Island, a colony safer for religious minorities. The Anne Hutchinson Memorial Association and the State Federation of Women’s Clubs funded this statue, which highlights Hutchinson’s role as a spiritual guide to women—even, one could argue, as an early feminist. She looks up to the sky, Bible held to her chest, as a young girl seeks protection at her side.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Massachusetts State House, on south lawn near Beacon St. and Bow","full_address":"Massachusetts State House, on south lawn near Beacon St. and Bow, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.06435,42.357817]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/55-bac_1x1-anne_hutchinson.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/AnneHutchinson_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"Massachusetts State House","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Beacon Hill","year":"1922"},

The work was installed after 9/11, in part to keep motor vehicles from approaching the building.Abstract public works like this one can be polarizing, sparking heated debates about the purpose of art and its relationship with the people who view it daily. For example, Richard Serra’s Tilted Arc of 1981—a 12-foot tall steel wall erected on Federal Plaza in New York City—was removed after local officials complained that the public found it cumbersome and depressing.

Later, as conductor of the Pops, Fiedler aimed to make classical music more accessible and popular, and his outdoor summer concerts drew crowds of up to 400,000. This sculpture is located near the Hatch Shell, where the Pops play every Fourth of July.

Look more closely, though, and you can see unique elements decorating the mansion’s façade. Both inside and outside, the Ayer Mansion is ornamented with colorful mosaics and windows created by the famed interior designer Louis Comfort Tiffany. It is one of only three houses known to contain Tiffany’s interior designs in their original site.Although Tiffany is known as a quintessential American artist, he looked to many other cultures for inspiration for his work. He traveled extensively throughout Europe and North Africa and developed a particular interest in Moorish and Islamic art. The designs Tiffany would create throughout his career combine centuries-old motifs and techniques with unique innovations. For instance, Tiffany developed new methods of making glass, and he found that placing foil behind his glass mosaics would make them reflect more light and deepen their color.","discipline":"Mosaic and stained glass","location_description":"395 Commonwealth Ave.","full_address":"395 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.0903,42.349293]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/2-bac_1x1-ayer_mansion_mosaics.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/2_ayer_mansion-1.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/2_ayer_mansion-2.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/AyerMansion_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"Private property (Bayridge Residence and Cultural Center)","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Mosaic and stained glass","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"1899"},

In a 1980 interview, Saarinen recalled that her interest in animals went back to her early childhood, when she used to stay up late at night sketching the mice that crept around her family’s brownstone.

According to historical records, the beacon was never used, but it eventually became a landmark. Heavy winds knocked down the original beacon in 1789, and architect Charles Bulfinch designed a new structure, consisting of a Doric brick column placed on a stone pedestal and topped with a gilded eagle.

Many of the poor in Ireland depended on potatoes as their primary food source, and about one-eighth of the population died from hunger or disease over the following years. Those more fortunate fled the country, with over 1.5 million Irish arriving in the United States. Boston was a favored place for the Irish start their new lives. This memorial was unveiled in June 1998 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine. The memorial includes eight narrative plaques about the Famine and two groups of figures, one deeply affected by the Famine, and the other looking healthy and well fed. Through these two opposed groups, sculptor Robert Shure has highlighted the significance of Ireland’s class structure during the Famine. Poor farmers and rural laborers were far more likely to die from hunger and disease than the urban population of white-collar workers.

The central medallion traces the marathon’s course from the suburb of Hopkinton to Boston’s Back Bay, and an elevation map shows off its notoriously difficult hills. Around this central medallion are inscribed the names of the marathon’s winners, including Bobbi Gibb. Initially disguised as a man, she first ran the marathon in 1966 when women, thought to not be physiologically capable, were not yet allowed to enter the race.

Here, a monument commemorates the events of March 5, 1770, when British soldiers, later to be successfully defended by John Adams, shot down five Bostonians. Crispus Attucks is the best known of these five. He is widely hailed as a hero of the American Revolution, although little information about him can be verified. According to some reports, Attucks was of African and Native American descent and had fled to Boston after escaping his enslavers. Attucks’ grave is located in the nearby Granary Burying Ground.At the column’s base, a bronze plaque illustrates the infamous event. Its two central figures are sculpted in high relief, meaning that parts of the figures are three-dimensional and jut out significantly from the background. You may notice that one figure’s hand is shinier than the surrounding bronze. It has been polished by visitors reaching out to touch it.A figure representing the Spirit of the Revolution presides over the monument. She triumphantly displays a broken chain to symbolize liberty, as well as an American flag. With one foot, she steps on the crown of the British monarchy, and next to her other foot, an eagle prepares to take flight. Her exposed breast and outstretched arm evoke the main figure in Eugène Delacroix’s iconic painting Liberty Guiding the People, a powerful symbol of the French Revolution that the sculptor, Robert Kraus, would have known.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Boston Common, near Tremont St. between Avery St. and West St.","full_address":"Boston Common, near Tremont St. between Avery St. and West St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.06441,42.354271]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/47-bac_1x1-boston_massacre_crispus_attucks_monument_932f.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/48-boston_massacre_monument_crispus_attucks_monument-1.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/48-boston_massacre_monument_crispus_attucks_monument-2.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/48-boston_massacre_monument_crispus_attucks_monument-3.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/BostonMassacreMonument_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1888"},

The first, Abigail Adams, served as confidant and advisor to her husband, President John Adams, and was a strong advocate of women’s rights. The second, poet Phillis Wheatley, became the first published African- American after being kidnapped from her family and enslaved as a child in Senegal and then sold as property to a couple in Massachusetts. The final figure is abolitionist and suffragist Lucy Stone, known for being the first woman to keep her own last name after marriage and one of the first American women to earn a college degree – which she personally funded.Sculptor Meredith Gang Bergmann modeled the figures in dynamic poses that invite viewer interaction. Unlike many of the large commemorative sculptures dotting Commonwealth Avenue, they are not perched upon high pedestals but instead stand at street level. By resisting the typically detached quality of commemorative sculpture, Bergmann pays a fitting tribute to these women and their revolutionary ideas.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Commonwealth Ave. Mall, between Gloucester St. and Fairfield St.","full_address":"Commonwealth Ave. Mall, between Gloucester St. and Fairfield St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.08334,42.350487]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/5-bac_1x1-boston_womens_memorial.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/5-boston_womens_memorial-1.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/5-boston_womens_memorial-3.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/5-boston_womens_memorial-2.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/5-boston_womens_memorial-4.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/BostonWomensMemorial_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Browne Fund","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"2003"},

The sculpture was first placed outside the Brewer home on Beacon Street and was moved to its current location a few years later. The fountain’s base features two couples from Greek mythology: the sea god Poseidon and his consort Amphitrite, and Acis and Galatea. In modern adaptations of an ancient Greek myth, Galatea is known as the statue who came to life after her sculptor, Pygmalion, fell in love with her. References to Greek and Roman myths can be found in much Neo-Classical art and architecture, which flourished during the 19th century.The fountain has sustained much damage over the years. In 1957, one figure was torn from its base and knocked over during a treasure hunt for the key to a free automobile. Expecting to find the key somewhere in the Boston Common, eager crowds searched through the flowers and shrubs and amongthe park’s many statues. Since then, the Brewer Fountain has since undergone extensive repairs to the stone basin and bronze figures, as well as the interior piping system.","discipline":"Sculptural fountain","location_description":"Boston Common, near Park St., Tremont St. and Temple Pl.","full_address":"Boston Common, near Park St., Tremont St. and Temple Pl., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.0631,42.356192]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/52-bac_1x1-brewer_fountain.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/52-brewer_fountain-1.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/52-brewer_fountain-2.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/52-brewer_fountain-3.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/52-brewer_fountain-4.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/BrewerFountain_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1867"},

In the years preceding the Civil War, Charles Sumner opposed making compromises with the South; after the war, he advocated full voting rights for Southern blacks. He also promoted penal reform and worked alongside Massachusetts politician Horace Mann to improve the public school system.Shortly after Sumner’s death in 1874, a competition was held to design a monument to him. Boston artist Anne Whitney initially beat out a roster of well-known competitors, including Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Martin Milmore, who are both featured on this Art Walk. Nevertheless, the judges disqualified Whitney when they discovered she was a woman. Claiming that it would be improper for a woman to sculpt a man’s legs, they chose Thomas Ball’s design instead—an ironic story behind an artwork intended to honor Sumner’s fight for equality. Twenty-seven years later, Whitney cast her original design in bronze, with a few minor alterations. It is now located in Harvard Square.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Boston Public Garden, on Boylston St. Mall","full_address":"Boston Public Garden, on Boylston St. Mall, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.06983,42.352415]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/33-bac_1x1-charles_sumner.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/33-charles_sumner-1.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/33-charles_sumner-2.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/CharlesSumner_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1878"},

During the 1840s, Webster consistently worked to facilitate compromise between northern and southern states to preserve the union and prevent war. His fellow politicians recognized him as a particularly eloquent and convincing speaker. Here, sculptor Hiram Powers has captured Webster as if he were standing before an audience, perhaps on the Senate floor. In his right hand, he holds a rolled-up scroll; his left hand rests on a fasces, a bundle of reeds surrounding an ax. During the time of the Roman Republic, fasces were carried as symbols of political power during processions and other events. Over the centuries, they have retained this association with governance, specifically with representative forms of government.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Massachusetts State House, on south lawn near Beacon St.","full_address":"Massachusetts State House, on south lawn near Beacon St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.06379,42.357799]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/57-bac_1x1-daniel_webster.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/DanielWebster_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"Massachusetts State House","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze on granite base","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1859"},

David Ignatius Walsh was the first Irish-Catholic governor of Massachusetts and also its first Irish-Catholic senator. As governor, Walsh fought to give women the right to vote and to reform the state’s labor compensation system. As senator—an office he held for 26 years—Walsh served on the Committee of Naval Affairs and opposed American entry into World War II. He actively participated in America First, an antiwar organization, until the attack on Pearl Harbor changed his views.Although this sculpture appears intact, its granite base is in fact missing three bronze relief plaques depicting an eagle, the Massachusetts seal, and the Navy’s insignia. The figure’s clothes are heavily stylized, which is to say that their long, linear folds seem more decorative than representational. Above the figure is a Latin inscription that translates as “Not for self, but for country,” the motto of the US Navy and also a fitting account of Walsh’s public service.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Charles River Esplanade, along Hatch Shell Circle","full_address":"Charles River Esplanade, along Hatch Shell Circle, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.07427,42.357032]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/24-bac_1x1-david_ignatius_walsh.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/24._david_ignatius_walsh-1.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/24._david_ignatius_walsh-2.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/24._david_ignatius_walsh-3.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/DavidIgnatiusWalsh_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"1954"},

Nast also helped to establish the elephant as the Republican Party mascot in a cartoon from 1874. Although the donkey had not been adopted as the official symbol of the Democratic Party, all twenty of the Democratic mayors who served at the Old City Hall used the well-known mascot. Our sculpted donkey is depicted looking down at a pair of footprints cast in bronze. The Republican elephant is inscribed in both footprints, and a cryptic message appears below: “stand in opposition.” But who is opposing what? Is the donkey standing up against the elephant?

He edited the Boston Daily Advertiser as well as other periodicals, and he authored a variety of works, from historical biographies to short stories and essays. An opponent of slavery, he was also a leader in the Social Gospel movement, which advocated for social reform in areas like labor, education, and sanitation. During the last several years of his life, Hale served as Chaplain for the US Senate. This 1913 bronze statue was sculpted by Bela Lyon Pratt and was financed through publicly donated funds. Pratt has portrayed Hale as an older man in a naturalistic pose. He is not depicted preaching or writing—the activities for which he was best known—but instead seems to be enjoying a moment alone, perhaps on a slightly labored stroll through a garden.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Boston Public Garden, near Charles St.","full_address":"Boston Public Garden, near Charles St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.06878,42.354505]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/40-BAC%201X1-Edward%20Everett%20Hale.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/40.%20Edward%20Everett%20Hale%20-%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/40.%20Edward%20Everett%20Hale%20-%202.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/EdwardEverettHale_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1913"},

Morton administered the ether, and Warren then removed a tumor from an unconscious patient. Ether had enormous benefits, allowing doctors to work more closely and carefully, and giving patients a respite not only from pain, but also from the anxiety associated with surgery.

Winthrop originally landed in the area of Charlestown, north of the current city center, but he relocated and joined Blackstone after finding Charlestown unsuitable for settlement.As Winthrop and the European settlers disembark, their ship, the Arabella, floats in the background. Among the newcomers is Ann Pollard, Boston’s first white female inhabitant – here depicted as a child though she was a woman at the time of her arrival. On the left of the main scene, two Native Americans observe the Europeans’ arrival to Shawmut, renamed Boston, not yet aware of the impending devastation to their culture by the European immigrants. On the right, a female figure representing Boston looks on, accompanied by a soldier. Together, the female figure and the soldier symbolize the growth of the city and the protection of its inhabitants. Interestingly, the depiction of William Blackstone resembles James Curley, mayor of Boston at the time of the commission.

During World War I, General Patton was assigned to the Tank Corps, as the US Army sought to harness the new technology of armored vehicles. He quickly became an expert on tanks, which he continued to study after the war’s end. When the US entered World War II, Patton commanded troops in North Africa and Sicily. Despite some setbacks in his career, including a reprimand for treating soldiers harshly, Patton was particularly successful as commander of the Third Army. Patton and his troops moved from France eastward, helping to avert German victory at the Battle of the Bulge and ultimately liberating the Buchenwald concentration camp on April 4, 1945.Before creating this work, sculptor James Earle Fraser worked as an assistant to Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who is well represented on this Art Walk. Fraser has depicted Patton as a sharp and intrepid leader, strategizing as he surveys the battlefield. Patton’s heroism is shown not through a contrived pose, but through the figure’s evident dedication to his military duties.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"West of Longfellow Bridge","full_address":"West of Longfellow Bridge, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.073979,42.357408]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/22.%20General%20George%20Smith%20Patton,%20Jr.%20-%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/22.%20General%20George%20Smith%20Patton,%20Jr.%20-%202.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/22.%20General%20George%20Smith%20Patton,%20Jr.%20-%203.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/GeneralGeorgeSmithPatton_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"1955"},

He obtained the post in 1863, after boldly writing to President Lincoln to complain about the incompetence of the military and to request a new commission. Hooker established himself as a dedicated and aggressive leader, as well as a capable administrator, and was deeply respected by his soldiers. After suffering a devastating defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville against General Robert E. Lee, Hooker transferred to a new post and contributed to General Ulysses S. Grant’s victory at the Battle of Chattanooga. Sculptors Daniel Chester French and Edward C. Potter have depicted Hooker in a traditionally heroic manner that allows viewers to literally look up the general in order to appreciate his role as a notable military leader. French created the figure of Hooker while Potter modeled the horse. This might explain why Hooker appears slightly stiff or even off-balance atop the horse. During his long career, French became one of the most important American sculptors of his era. Nearly all Americans are familiar with atleast one of his works: the towering statue of President Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Massachusetts State House, at east wing entrance on Beacon St.","full_address":"Massachusetts State House, at east wing entrance on Beacon St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.06312,42.35796]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/59-BAC%201X1-General%20Joseph%20Hooker.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/59.%20General%20Joseph%20Hooker%20-%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/59.%20General%20Joseph%20Hooker%20-%202.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/GeneralJosephHooker_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"Massachusetts State House","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and red granite","neighborhood":"Beacon Hill","year":"1903"},

Long before the fight for American independence began, Washington had distinguished himself as a British colonel during the French and Indian War. He returned to civilian life when the war ended, and he only gradually came to oppose British rule. As fighting escalated between the colonial and British troops, Washington recognized the need for a unified army of resistance. He agreed to lead the newly formed Continental Army in 1775, and, fourteen years later, was unanimously elected to become the first President of the United States. Despite his popularity, Washington felt reluctant to accept the Presidency, and he voluntarily resigned after his second term. Thomas Ball’s sculpture therefore shows Washington in the role he was more comfortable assuming—that of a military leader, not a politician. He appears calm and assured, even while leading a largely untrained and ill-prepared army against one of the world’s strongest military powers.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Boston Public Garden, near Arlington St.","full_address":"Boston Public Garden, near Arlington St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.070964,42.353836]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/29-BAC%201X1-George%20Washington.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/29.%20George%20Washington%20-%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/29.%20George%20Washington%20-%202.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/29.%20George%20Washington%20-%203.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/GeorgeWashington_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"1869"},

Numerous sections of the city’s current land were created through landfill, including most of South Boston and the entire Back Bay. In fact, colonial Boston was less than half the size the city is now. A new public artwork in the South End entitled LandWave, will mark the narrow isthmus that once led visitors to Boston.Local artist Ross Miller has demarcated the original Boston Harbor of 1630 by etching the old shoreline onto the present site.

When the war ended, Lodge stridently opposed President Wilson’s Fourteen Points and helped to block participation in the League of Nations, believing that the penalties imposed on Germany were too weak and would not prevent the country from once again becoming a military threat. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts commissioned this sculpture a few years after Lodge’s death. Local artist Raymond Averill Porter, a faculty member at the Boston Museum School, chose to commemorate Lodge with a likeness that appears neither impassioned nor heroic, but instead contemplative and perhaps a bit weary.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Massachusetts State House, on south lawn near Beacon St.","full_address":"Massachusetts State House, on south lawn near Beacon St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.06376,42.357912]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/54-BAC%201X1-Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/54-Henry_Cabot_Lodge.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/HenryCabotLodge_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1932"},

As a child, Mann was kept busy working on his family’s farm in Franklin, MA, and he attended school only three months out of the year. But he educated himself at the local library and went on to attend Brown University, where he developed an interest in social reform and education. After graduating as valedictorian, Mann pursued a career as a lawyer and then as a politician. He left the state Senate in 1837 to serve as the first Massachusetts Secretary of Education in 1837 and worked tirelessly to bolster public schools by increasing funding, promoting legislation, and improving training for teachers. Mann ended his career in education as President of Antioch College in Ohio—one of the few institutions to accept African-American students at the time.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Massachusetts State House, on south lawn near Beacon St.","full_address":"Massachusetts State House, on south lawn near Beacon St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.06376,42.357904]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/58-BAC%201X1-Horace%20Mann.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/58-Horace_Mann.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/HoraceMann_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1865"},

The Hungarian Revolution began in the fall of 1956, when a group of students demonstrating in Budapest were shot at by the Soviet state police. The uprising quickly spread as Hungarians wrested control of their government from the Soviets. After delaying their response, the Soviets moved to quash the uprising and restore their rule, killing over 2,500 Hungarians in the fighting that ensued. Although the Soviets regained control of the country, their brutal response undermined the legitimacy of Soviet communism and created rifts among their European sympathizers.Here, sculptor Gyuri Hollósy pays tribute to the heroism of Hungary’s citizens. The female figure atop the sculpture, who raises her baby toward the sky, stands on a foundation of rubble mixed with the bodies of young demonstrators. Amid the chaos, a wounded man waves the Hungarian flag. Hollósy created his sculpture from many overlapping pieces of bronze, creating a highly textured and expressive surface that enhances the emotional intensity of the scene. A plaque next to the memorial quotes John F. Kennedy praising Hungarians for their “courage, conscience, and triumph.”The violence of 1956 prompted thousands of Hungarians to flee, some settling in the United States. In 2006, on the revolution’s fiftieth anniversary, Boston’s Hungarian community gathered around this memorial to remember the uprising and celebrate Hungary’s hard-won democracy.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Liberty Square Park, at Kilby St. and Water St.","full_address":"Liberty Square Park, at Kilby St. and Water St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.05509,42.357863]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/83-BAC%201X1-Hungarian%20Revolution%20Monument.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/83-Hungarian_Revolution_Memorial.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/HungarianRevolutionMem_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"","funders":"Hungarian Society of Massachusetts","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1986"},

This lantern is believed to date to the 16th century, but little else is known about it.Bunkio Matsuki was born into a family of artists and temple builders in Japan. He originally trained to be a Buddhist monk but immigrated to the US in 1888, where he chose a very different profession: promoting Japanese art and culture to the American public. Matsuki managed a store in Boston specializing in Japanese art and antiques. He also worked for governments and museums to appraise and inspect art objects and published a journal called Lotus. During the early 20th century, oriental designs were considered exotic and fashionable among well-to-do Americans, and Matsuki’s Boston store certainly contributed to the trend.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Boston Public Garden, near footbridge","full_address":"Boston Public Garden, near footbridge, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.07029,42.354374]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/27-BAC%201X1-Japanese%20Lantern.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/27.%20Japanese%20Lantern%20-%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/27.%20Japanese%20Lantern%20-%202.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/JapaneseLantern_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Iron","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"1587 / 1904"},

Kennedy served first in the House of Representatives and then in the Senate after ousting incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. (grandson of Henry Cabot Lodge, commemorated nearby). On January 20, 1961, Kennedy became the youngest elected president of the United States, at age 43. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, a day forever etched into American history. This sculpture captures Kennedy’s youth and poise as he walks confidently out of the Massachusetts State House. With his arms bent and his gaze focused straight ahead, the figure appears to stride with a purpose in mind—perhaps his destination or the next task at hand. Eight maple leaves and 68 seedpods are inscribed on the pedestal, which together represent death and regeneration. The statue was dedicated on the 73rd anniversary of Kennedy’s birth.

In fact, Copley became well known on both sides of the Atlantic and was elected into England’s prestigious Royal Academy of Arts, an elite association of artists. As a portrait painter, Copley aimed to capture the personalities of his wealthy and influential subjects, and he often depicted them among objects or furnishings that revealed their interests and tastes.

Quincy came from a politically active family, and his father had been an outspoken opponent of British oppression in the years leading up to the Revolutionary War. Ball captures this legacy through his stately portrayal of a focused yet serene leader. During the five years he served as Mayor of Boston, Quincy expanded the Faneuil Hall marketplace—a bustling commercial center for a quickly growing city. In order to secure a large enough site, he had some of the neighboring harbor filled in with dirt. (This was not the first time the land’s topology had been changed to accommodate new buildings. See below for Ross Miller’s contemporary artwork, Harbor Shoreline, which outlines the harbor’s location during the 17th century.) Today, the entire marketplace is often referred to as Quincy Market, since one of the buildings bears the former Mayor’s name. Quincy left his post in 1829 to become the 16th president of Harvard College. This statue is placed at the site of the Old City Hall, although the building where Quincy served was replaced in 1865 with the structure that remains today.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Old City Hall, in courtyard on School St.","full_address":"Old City Hall, in courtyard on School St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.05951,42.357794]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Quincy_1X1_revised-1.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/74.%20Josiah%20Quincy%20-%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/74.%20Josiah%20Quincy%20-%202.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/JosiahQuincy_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1879"},

Horsford commissioned the statue, some people believed that Eriksson and his crew landed on the shore of Massachusetts and founded their settlement, called Vinland, here. However, most scholars now consider Vinland to be located on the Canadian coast.This piece was created by a notable Boston sculptor, Anne Whitney. Several of her pieces can be found around the city.

In between his terms, Curley was elected to the House of Representatives and the Governor’s Office, and he also spent several months in jail for fraud. Though he never lacked enemies, Curley remained popular among his constituents, who benefited from the major public improvements he sponsored. Most notably, he renovated public spaces, created new jobs, and expanded access to healthcare and transportation.This tribute to Curley was funded by the Edward Ingersoll Browne Fund, created in 1892 to beautify the City of Boston. Local artist Lloyd Lillie won the commission with two bronze likenesses of the former mayor, one standing wearing a campaign button and one seated casually on a bench. At the statue’s unveiling, Mayor Kevin White (see above) claimed that the two statues illustrated “the duality of Curley’s appeal” as both “a man of authority and a man with a genuine concern and compassion for the public he served.” On the accompanying plaque, an inscription from Shakespeare’s Hamlet acknowledges Curley’s extraordinary personality, as well as his imperfections.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Curley Memorial Park, at Congress St. and North St.","full_address":"Curley Memorial Park, at Congress St. and North St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.05701,42.360508]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/88-BAC%201X1-Mayor%20James%20Michael%20Curley.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/89-Mayor_Curley.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"Browne Fund","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1980"},

Along less serious lines, he also convinced the Rhode Island State Police to release the members of the Rolling Stones from jail so that they could make a scheduled appearance in Boston.

The mosaic technique dates back thousands of years, to when artists first began to arrange pebbles and small stones into patterns. As the technique became more refined, artists experimented with various materials—most frequently ceramic and glass—in order to achieve certain effects. For example, ceramic tiles (called “tesserae”) are opaque and can be deeply colored, whereas glass tesserae reflect light. Cultures from all over Europe and the Middle East have used mosaics to decorate both secular and religious buildings, including synagogues and mosques. Created with glazed ceramic pieces, this contemporary work recalls the natural themes prevalent in many Islamic mosaics, but it features a more open, less geometric design.","discipline":"Mosaic","location_description":"Boston Common, near Beacon St. and Frog Pond","full_address":"Boston Common, near Beacon St. and Frog Pond, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.064646,42.35614]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/49-BAC%201X1-Mosaics%20in%20Tadpole%20Playground.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/47.%20Mosaic%20in%20Tadpole%20Playground%20-%202.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/47.%20Mosaic%20in%20Tadpole%20Playground%20-%203.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Ceramic and concrete","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"2003"},

Slightly smaller than life-sized, they represent Boston’s intellectual, spiritual, and industrial energy. To help us identify each figure’s significance, the artists gave them attributes: Learning clutches a book, Industry wields a jackhammer, and Religion holds no material objects but instead kneels with his palms outspread, as if in prayer.

Cyrus Edwin Dallin depicts Revere on his famous “midnight ride” of 1775, alerting his fellow colonists that the British army was moving toward Lexington, MA. Dallin emphasizes the urgency and energy of Revere’s mission through the posture of both the horse and its rider. Revere attempts to keep his balance as his horse abruptly halts, rearing back slightly. Dallin’s design also seems to recognize the presence of his viewers. Walk over to Revere’s right side, and you play the role of a colonist receiving his message.During the 18th and 19th centuries, several myths and misconceptions about Revere’s ride came to be accepted as truth. In fact, Revere did not yell “The British are coming!” so as not to be overheard by British informants, and he was only one among dozens of riders who spread the message on horseback. His midnight ride was perhaps less important to American independence than the work he did as an engraver. With his widely circulated depictions of the Boston Massacre and other events, Revere helped to incite anger towards the British and sympathy towards the colonists. Despite the myths, Revere has retained his significance as a key symbol of the energy and courage that drove colonists in their fight against imperial rule, and Dallin has placed him in this familiar role.Although Dallin designed this sculpture for a competition in 1885, it was not cast in bronze until 1940. The statue’s installation was halted for several years, after another artist assailed Dallin’s winning submission, calling it unrealistic. In the 1930s, the Daughters of the American Revolution petitioned to have the commission completed.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Paul Revere Mall, between Hanover St. and Salem St.","full_address":"Paul Revere Mall, between Hanover St. and Salem St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.05323,42.365558]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/96-BAC%201X1-Paul%20Revere.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/98-Paul_Revere.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"North End","year":"1940"},

His best-known work is Auld Lang Syne, traditionally sung on New Year’s Eve. Small details and personal touches set this sculpture of Burns apart from many of the other bronze sculptures featured on the Public Art Tour. The poet is depicted on a stroll through the countryside, accompanied by a book and his Collie dog. His walking stick and well-worn shoes give the impression that he went on such excursions often. They also illustrate the pastoral themes so prevalent in his verse.

It commemorates the Massachusetts 54th Regiment, the first volunteer regiment of African-American soldiers, active during the Civil War. The Regiment was led by white colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the son of prominent Boston abolitionists.Shaw and his regiment are famous for their assault on Fort Wagner in 1863. Outnumbered, many of the troops, including Shaw, were killed and buried in a mass grave by Confederate soldiers. One of the soldiers who survived the assault, William H. Carney, received a Medal of Honor in recognition of his bravery. The 54th also reportedly included Frederick Douglass’ two sons and the grandson of abolitionist Sojourner Truth.In the relief, an angel accompanies the men as they march down Beacon Street on May 28, 1863, leaving Boston to head south. She holds an olive branch, which symbolizes peace, and poppies, which symbolize death. Through this imagery, Saint-Gaudens alludes to both the soldiers’ individual fates and the North’s eventual victory. Other features of the relief are realistic, rather than symbolic. For example, each soldier’s face is markedly distinct, endowed with a unique appearance and expression. Saint-Gaudens’ respect for the soldiers is shown through his efforts to portrays them as individuals, not simply as a group. In 1982, the names of the African-American soldiers who died were added to the reverse side of the memorial.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Boston Common, at Beacon St. and Park St.","full_address":"Boston Common, at Beacon St. and Park St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.0635,42.357485]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/53-BAC%201X1-Robert%20Shaw%20and%20the%2054th%20Regiment.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/53.%20Robert%20Gould%20Shaw%20and%20the%2054th%20Regiment%20-%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/53.%20Robert%20Gould%20Shaw%20and%20the%2054th%20Regiment%20-%202.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/53.%20Robert%20Gould%20Shaw%20and%20the%2054th%20Regiment%20-%204.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/RobertGouldShawandthe54thRegiment_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Marble and granite","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"1897"},

Adams began his political career as a tax collector and a vocal critic of unfair taxation on the colonies. Along with John Hancock, he founded the Sons of Liberty to protest the StampAct and later served as a delegate to the Continental Congresses. After the Revolution, Adams remained firmly opposed to strong centralized government, even in the new nation he helped to establish.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Faneuil Hall Plaza, at Congress St. and North St.","full_address":"Faneuil Hall Plaza, at Congress St. and North St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.05669,42.359981]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/85-BAC%201X1-Samuel%20Adams.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/85-Samuel_Adams.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/SamuelAdams_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1880"},

Its design incorporates a number of abstract symbols. For example, four figures at the base of the column symbolize the cardinal directions of North, South, East, and West. Crowning the column is an allegorical female figure representing the Genius of America. Lastly, four bronze plaques located on the base show troops departing to and returning from war, while the other two pay tribute to the Navy and the Boston Sanitation Commission. Boston sculptor Martin Milmore created the monument, and Harvard president Charles W. Eliot penned the featured inscription. In honoring ordinary soldiers and sailors, rather than military leaders, this work set an important precedent adopted by the designers of subsequent memorials.Originally, the sculpture also included four bronze figures, each placed at a corner of the monument’s base and representing Peace, the Sailor, the Muse of History, and the Soldier. These figures are in need of repair and were removed to prevent further deterioration. The memorial, among many others, is up for adoption in the Boston Art Commission’s Adopt-A-Statue program, which raises the funds needed to repair and maintain works of public art.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Boston Common, on Flagstaff Hill","full_address":"Boston Common, on Flagstaff Hill, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.0664,42.355457]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/45-BAC%201X1-Soldiers'%20and%20Sailors'%20Monument.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/45.%20Soldiers'%20and%20Sailors'%20Monument%20-%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/45.%20Soldiers'%20and%20Sailors'%20Monument%20-%202.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","audio_description":"http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/SoldiersandSailors_Cook.mp3_.mp3","collection":"","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"1877"},

As you walk around the sculpture, its shape changes markedly, and you may find that it evokes other associations. For example, Pepper views her artwork as emotionallyexpressive.

Phillips later abandoned his legal practice to devote himself entirely to abolitionism, and like Garrison, he became known as a particularly eloquent speaker. In 1837, Phillips delivered a passionate speech at Faneuil Hall condemning the murder of the abolitionist minister Elijah Lovejoy. He also advocated for the rights of Native Americans, women, and prisoners. This statue by Daniel Chester French honors Phillips’s commitment to liberation, symbolized by the broken chain clutched in the figure’s left hand.

Structures like this one serve both as entryways to important sites and as commemorations for significant people and events. Additionally, many overseas Chinatowns feature a pai lou in order to symbolize the presence of a Chinese community. In 1976, Taiwan gifted the materials for this gate to the City of Boston, sister city of Taipei, in honor of America’s bicentennial. The Chinatown gate was not actually assembled until 1982, when it was dedicated during the August Moon Festival, a harvest celebration. Over the years, this gate has required extensive renovations, due in part to weather-induced damage and nearby construction on the Big Dig.Sitting at the base of the wood-and-tile arch are two marble foo dog sculptures. In China and Taiwan, pairs of foo dogs, one male and one female, can often be found flanking the entranceway of palaces, Buddhist temples, government buildings, and even some private residences. The male foo dog rests one paw on a ball, while the female stands over a tiny cub. Believed to ward off evil, the dogs protect the inhabitants of the structure they guard. This gate’s original foo dog statues were badly damaged and replaced in 2007 with copies. Another identical pair is installed in the Chinese burial grounds at Mt. Hope Cemetery in Mattapan, where over a thousand Chinese immigrants have been laid to rest since 1930.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Chinatown Gateway, at Beach St.","full_address":"Chinatown Gateway, at Beach St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.059734,42.351221]},"image_urls":[],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Marble","neighborhood":"Chinatown","year":"1977 / 2007"},

This variety of pear was first cultivated in 1830 at the Clapp family farm, located two blocks from Edward Everett Square, now a bustling urban intersection. In the course of designing the sculpture, Baring-Gould collaborated with the Dorchester Historical Society to collect the oral histories of a diverse variety of neighborhood residents. She also conducted research in local archives and museums and held over a hundred meetings with civic leaders to discuss how her work should represent the Dorchester community. While the pear represents Dorchester and its people as a whole, Baring-Gould has created a series of smaller sculptures to highlight the individual stories of the Dorchester residents she’s come to know. Life-sized renditions of everyday objects—a baseball mitt, oyster shells, a telephone—illustrate their professions and pastimes. At the base of each sculpture, quotations from Dorchester residents, both living and long gone, hint at the significance of these objects.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Edward Everett Sq., at Massachusetts Ave. and Columbia Rd.","full_address":"Edward Everett Sq., at Massachusetts Ave. and Columbia Rd., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.061488,42.32023]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/DSCN5535.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/DSCN5538.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/DSCN5550.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/DSCN5595.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/DSCN5601.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/DSCN5613_0.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Browne Fund","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Dorchester","year":"2010"},

The remains of the fountain were found in Franklin Park, where the fountain was re-erected in 1979. In 1992, after the fountain was hit by a truck, it was rebuilt and placed in Everett Square.Today, the fountain no longer runs.

Years of industrial use had contaminated the soil and attracted illegal dumpers.  Chelsea Creek—the site of the Revolutionary War’s first naval battle—had long ago become a major waterway, attracting heavy industry to its shores and hastening the destruction of the area’s natural marshes.In the late ‘90s, the East Boston Chelsea Creek Action Group and the Boston Parks Department joined forces to transform this public hazard into a public park. Boston-born artist B. Amore was chosen to design a work of art, and, looking to weave her artistic contribution into the overall design of the park, Amore opted to recycle natural materials recovered from the site. The large stones that form her sculpture were originally part of an old seawall. Arranged in the shape of a boat, they evoke East Boston’s connection to the water, as well as its maritime industry. In 2007, six decorative steel fence panels by East Boston resident Leigh Hall were added to the parkland alongside Chelsea Creek. With a recreated salt marsh and native plants flourishing nearby, both Amore’s and Hall’s artworks point to a healthier relationship between humans and the marine resources we use.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"300 Condor St.","full_address":"300 Condor St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.029731,42.383088]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Condor%20Street%20Park%20Chelsea%20Creek%20Clipper.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Condor%20Street%202.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Browne Fund","medium":"Quarry stone","neighborhood":"East Boston","year":"2003"},

Although LeFevre creates art in a variety of media, his most ubiquitous works are the dozens of small bronze plaques he’s set into city sidewalks and squares, including the “Boston Bricks” on Winthrop Street, near Downtown Crossing. These bronze plaques were installed in the Hyde Park Business Distinct in 2000, as part of a larger project to design several pocket parks in the area. Like many of LeFevre’s plaques, they provide glimpses into the neighborhood’s history and culture. One commemorates a group of forty Hyde Park women, who in 1870 protested their inability to vote by casting invalid ballots in a local election. Among them were the well-known abolitionists Sarah and Angelica Grimké. Other plaques featuring images of books and literary quotations refer to the Hyde Park branch of the Boston Public Library, which is located nearby on Harvard Street.","discipline":"Plaque","location_description":"Harvard Ave. and Winthrop St., across from Hyde Park Library","full_address":"Harvard Ave. and Winthrop St., across from Hyde Park Library, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.122478,42.256808]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Hyde-Park-Plaques1.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Hyde-Park-Plaques5.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Hyde-Park-Plaques6.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Hyde-Park-Plaques10.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Hyde-Park-Plaques_Nikon2.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Hyde-Park-Plaques_Nikon4.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Browne Fund","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Hyde Park","year":"2000"},

The original mural was created by Rafael Rivera Garcia, a Puerto Rican artist and university professor. Much of Rivera Garcia’s art features the myths and culture of the Taino people, indigenous inhabitants of the Caribbean. This mural features the Huraca’n, meaning literally “center of the storm”—a word later adopted by the Spaniards to describe tropical cyclones. The Huraca’n trio is made up of the angry wind goddess Guabancex and her two helpers, the gods Guatauba and Coatrisque, who stir up the lightning and the water. By 2001, the mural was in urgent need of restoration: the original paint was faded and peeling, with further damage caused by water and graffiti. Hoping to preserve it, the Hyde/Jackson Square Main Street association contacted Heidi Schork and the Mayor’s Mural Crew. When Schork and her group of teenage artists began work on the restoration, no original drawings of the mural were available, and the wall was so damaged that determining the original colors and design was, as Schork described it, “akin to an archeological project.” The crew strove to replicate Rivera Garcia’s original intentions.","discipline":"Mural","location_description":"Perkins St. and Centre St., behind Hi-Lo Supermarket","full_address":"Perkins St. and Centre St., behind Hi-Lo Supermarket, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.110957,42.321665]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Taino-Indians5.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Taino-Indians6.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Taino-Indians9.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Taino-Indians11.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Taino-Indians12.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Taino-Indians13.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Acrylic paint","neighborhood":"Jamaica Plain","year":"1984 / 2003"},

Local artists, former Mattapan residents, and cousins Fern Cunningham and Karen Eutemey each created one of the two sculptural groups. Cunningham’s contribution celebrates the diverse history of Mattapan, which has been home to many different ethnic populations. A Native American figure holding a fish represents the Mattahunt tribe, which inhabited the area 400 years ago. Other images include a black Civil War soldier from Massachusetts’ 54th Regiment, which set up camp in the area, and Jewish, German, and Irish immigrants, who settled here in the first half of the twentieth century. Atop the sculpture, a young family illustrates Mattpan’s current population, consisting largely of African-Americans and Caribbean immigrants. Across the way, Eutemy's more abstract piece evokes a positive future, illustrated through the symbol of a rising sun. The mask-like faces below belong to no clearly defined racial or ethnic group. Explaining the significance of their work, Cunningham and Eutemy borrowed the words of Dr. Martin Luther King: “Live together as brothers or perish together as fools.” Other works by Cunningham, including a tribute to Harriet Tubman, can be found throughout the city of Boston.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Mattapan Sq.,at Blue Hill Ave. and Cummins Hwy.","full_address":"Mattapan Sq.,at Blue Hill Ave. and Cummins Hwy., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.094022,42.267518]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Mattapan%20square%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Mattapan%20square%20artwork%20Rise%20Detail%202.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Mattapan%20Square%20Artwork%20Rise%20Detail%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Mattapan%20Square%20Rise%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Mattapan%20Square%20Rise%202.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Browne Fund","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Mattapan","year":"2005"},

Many notable artists of the twentieth century, such as Picasso, studied and admired African art for its abstract visual language, its bold geometrical forms, and its imaginative treatment of the human body.Maduna once described this work as “an image of restraint and dignity.” To create it, he found inspiration in the art and culture of the Dogon people, who live in modern-day Mali, and who are especially known for their figurative sculptures and ceremonial masks. “My art is one way I can maintain a connection with my roots,” Maduna once explained. But, speaking of traditional African artists, he noted, “theirs was not my life experience. The belief systems that motivated those forms were not mine.” Therefore, Maduna viewed his work as a synthesis of African and Western forms.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Dudley Sq., near Civic Plaza at Warren St. and Kearsarge Ave.","full_address":"Dudley Sq., near Civic Plaza at Warren St. and Kearsarge Ave., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.083445,42.327543]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Maduna_Judge_Roxbury.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"Roxbury Municipal Court","funders":"Browne Fund","medium":"Painted steel","neighborhood":"Roxbury","year":"1989"},

In order to ensure that his sculptures could endure Boston’s strong gusts, Amory tested scaled-down models in a wind tunnel facility at MIT.

Connolly was born in South Boston in 1869, one of twelve children in an Irish immigrant family. Despite his lack of a formal education, Connolly passed the entrance exam to Harvard College and began his studies there at the age of 27. But Connolly opted to drop out of school to compete in the first Olympic Games of the modern era, held in 1896 in Athens. The Games kicked off with the hop, skip, and jump event—similar to today’s triple jump. Connolly took first place in the event, making him the first Olympic champion in over 1500 years. (However, it would be inaccurate to call Connolly a ‘gold medalist,’ since silver medals, not gold, were awarded for first place in 1896.) Connolly also competed in the Paris Olympics of 1900, where he took second in the hop, skip, and jump event.This dynamic sculpture shows Connolly in the process of landing a long jump, planting his heels and thrusting his torso forward in an effort to keep his balance. As his athletic career came to a close, Connolly focused his energies on writing, serving as correspondent during World War I for several publications, including the Boston Globe. Before his death in 1957, he published numerous novels and short stories, mostly about life at sea, which gained him the admiration of English poet T.S. Eliot and president Teddy Roosevelt.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Columbus Park, near Old Colony Ave.","full_address":"Columbus Park, near Old Colony Ave., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.051403,42.323881]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Connolly.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"Browne Fund","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"South Boston","year":"1987"},

This 10-foot bronze statue is dedicated to the memory of Harriet Tubman, the famous abolitionist and Underground Railroad ‘conductor.’ Born around 1820—her exact date of birth is unknown—Tubman spent the first 28 years of her life toiling in the household and fields of the Maryland plantation where she had been born. When the plantation’s owner died, Tubman escaped, following the North Star and stopping at various Underground Railroad ‘stations’ along the 90-mile journey to Pennsylvania. But Tubman did not remain safely in the North for long. Within a year, she returned to Maryland to help members of her family escape. What began as a plot to reunite her family became a broader mission to free as many people as possible, personal relations as well as strangers. Over the next decade, Tubman took nineteen trips to the South, guiding over 300 individuals to freedom. Although she was illiterate and received no formal education, Tubman became known as one of the most adroit Underground Railroad conductors. A $40,000 reward was posted for her capture.Here, local sculptor Fern Cunningham shows Tubman leading a small group up north. She strides forward confidently, with a Bible tucked under her left arm—a reference to both her religious devotion and her Biblical nickname, Moses. Interestingly, the men and women behind her appear calm and assured. Perhaps their journey is coming to an end, or perhaps their expressions are not literal but symbolic, illustrating the spirit of courage and devotion that drove Tubman on. Although Tubman never lived in Boston, she had links to the city through her network of abolitionist friends, one of whom opened the Harriet Tubman House as a settlement house for black women who had migrated from the South. The house has since relocated, but it still exists today as part of the United South End Settlements program. The other artwork located in the Harriet Tubman Park is Emancipation by Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller, one of the leading female artists of the Harlem Renaissance movement. Fuller created this work in 1913 for a New York exposition celebrating the 50th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s order abolishing slavery.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Harriet Tubman Park, at Pembroke St. and Columbus Ave.","full_address":"Harriet Tubman Park, at Pembroke St. and Columbus Ave., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.077864,42.343454]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Cunningham_Tubman_SEnd.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Cunningham_Tubman_SEnd_2.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Cunningham_Tubman_SEnd_3.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"The Browne Fund","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"South End","year":"1999"},

Residents founded and participated in a variety of programs, such as tutoring, gardening, and operating a closed-circuit television channel.This mural was created with the support of the Villa Victoria tenants’ association, Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción, to decorate the Villa’s central gathering place. Local artists Lili Ann Killen Rosenberg, Nora Valdez, and Roberto Chao were assisted by Villa Victoria residents, children as well as adults, who made the ceramic tile pieces.

But, despite this emphasis on the past, Aqueous Humour also acknowledges the technological advances that modernized Boston’s waterfront.

His intensely realistic paintings—ranging in subject from grimy bathroom sinks to expansive Madrid cityscapes—often take him years of meticulous work to complete. These sculptures, and several other recent works by Lopez, were inspired by the birth of his grandchildren. When his second grandchild, Carmen, was a few months old, Lopez began modeling two portraits of her head, one depicting her awake and the other asleep. In an interview given at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Lopez explained that these sculptures presented his first opportunity to work on a monumental scale. The process of transforming his intimate portraits into large-scale bronzes endowed them with an entirely different, unexpected character. “Your starting point is the representation of everyday life, and what is close to you,” he reflected, but “what is created becomes about many things, known and unknown.” Night and Day are now in the MFA’s permanent collection.

During his childhood, he began sculpting small figures and animals out of clay—a pastime introduced to him by his Ute neighbors. Even after moving to Boston in 1880, and later pursuing his studies in Paris, Dallin remained interested in Native American themes. One of his earliest successes was the sculpture Signal of Peace, which Dallin showed in a Paris exhibition in 1890. Not yet thirty years old, Dallin had already established his reputation as perhaps the finest sculptor of Native American subjects, known for his nuanced, un-stereotypical depictions.Like Signal of Peace, Appeal to the Great Spirit features a Sioux chief on horseback. Here, though, the chief’s arms are spread wide in a gesture of surrender, and he appears to be asking for spiritual assistance. Who has defeated this chief, and possibly his entire people— a group of white settlers, aiming to uproot the Native Americans from their homeland? Dallin leaves the story open-ended, although in his personal correspondence, he frequently expressed sympathy for the Native Americans and disgust with their mistreatment at the hands of whites and the US government.This sculpture won a gold medal at the Paris Salon on 1909. The Boston Museum of Fine Arts then raised the funds needed to buy the work. Although Appeal to the Great Spirit has become an icon of American art, Dallin’s best-known work in Boston is probably his sculpture of Paul Revere, located in the North End.  A museum to the artist can be found in Arlington, Massachusetts.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Museum of Fine Arts, at Huntington Ave.","full_address":"Museum of Fine Arts, at Huntington Ave., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.09369,42.338784]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/558%20Great%20Spirit.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"Museum of Fine Arts","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Fenway","year":"1909"},

Years of industrial use had contaminated the soil and attracted illegal dumpers.  Chelsea Creek—the site of the Revolutionary War’s first naval battle—had long ago become a major waterway, attracting heavy industry to its shores and hastening the destruction of the area’s natural marshes. In the late ‘90s, the East Boston Chelsea Creek Action Group (CCAG) and the Boston Parks Department joined forces to transform this public hazard into a public park.In 2007, the CCAG and Boston Parks Department enlisted the help of East Boston artist, Leigh Hall, to address the park’s need for interpretive signage and deter vandalism. Hall designed six ornamental steel fence panels depicting flora and fauna that might be seen in habitats like those in or near the Urban Wild to be installed alongside Chelsea Creek. It is the artist’s hope that park visitors will recognize some of the plants and animals in the panels, be inspired to look for them in the environment of the park, and in doing so become more observant and appreciative of the natural world. ","discipline":"Sculptural fence","location_description":"300 Condor St.","full_address":"300 Condor St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.029731,42.383088]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/meadow_0.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/saltmarsh_0.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/tidepool_0.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/trees_0.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/underwater_0.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/wildflowers_0.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Boston Parks Department and an anonymous source","medium":"Steel","neighborhood":"East Boston","year":"2007"},

After immigrating to the US, he attended the Boston Latin School and worked as an apprentice to the acclaimed sculptor Thomas Ball, helping Ball to create his famous equestrian statue of George Washington (located in Boston’s Public Garden). Under Ball’s tutelage, Milmore became a nationally recognized commemorative sculptor. Several of Milmore’s major works can be found nearby—in the Boston Common, in Cambridge’s Mount Auburn Cemetery, and in Jamaica Plain’s Forest Hills Cemetery, where Milmore is buried. There, an impressive bronze relief by Daniel Chester French commemorates Milmore and his brother, Joseph, a stonecutter.Milmore had a particular talent for commemorative military sculptures. This memorial, dating to 1872, commemorates the Charlestown men who fought on land and sea to preserve their country’s unity. It is located in the Charlestown training field, where colonial minutemen trained during the American Revolution. It features an allegorical female figure of Liberty, draped in classical-style robes, who places laurels on the heads of a soldier and a sailor representing the Army and the Navy. The memorial was recently cleaned and restored, thanks to the efforts of the Charlestown Preservation Society.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"The Training Field, Winthrop Square, at Winthrop St., Adams St.","full_address":"The Training Field, Winthrop Square, at Winthrop St., Adams St., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.060225,42.374786]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/CharlestownSoldiers_web2.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Charlestown_TrainingField.JPG"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"City of Boston","funders":"Unknown","medium":"Granite","neighborhood":"Charlestown","year":"1871"},

This figure is a portrait of Archer Alexander, a former slave who risked his life to notify the Union army that Confederates had sabotaged a railroad bridge over which Union troops were planning to travel. Fearing retribution, Alexander fled. He is believed to be one of the last individuals captured under the Fugitive Slave Act. Sculptor Thomas Ball has been criticized for representing Alexander as kneeling at Lincoln’s feet. But others might interpret the work differently and claim that Alexander’s posture is not that of a kneeling man but of one rising to claim his new freedom. The Emancipation Group was given to Boston in 1879 by Moses Kimball, a local politician and founder of the no-longer extant Boston Museum.

In the glory of their youth we shall remember them.”This monument is surely one of the last World War I memorials to be erected in the United States, if not the last. The sculptor Henry Albert Atkins created a design for a monument shortly after the war, but it was not erected because of insufficient funds. However, the money that had been raised for Atkins’ monument remained in a bank account, where it sat untouched for over thirty years until Frederick Davis, a local businessman, discovered the forgotten sum. Davis became the main proponent to resurrect the WWI Memorial project. He chaired a community committee, which held a new design competition won by Gordon Carr. The monument was dedicated in 1959, and Roslindale finally had its World War I Memorial.

Winthrop was a man of deep faith, and he viewed his voyage to America less as a business venture than as a spiritual pilgrimage. For Winthrop and his fellow Puritan colonists, New England presented the opportunity to build a devout Christian society—what Winthrop referred to in a famous sermon as the “city upon the hill.” Under Winthrop’s guidance, Massachusetts became a strictly Puritan colony.  * highlighted notes Greenough’s first sculpture of Winthrop was a marble statue he made for Statuary Hall in the Capitol at Washington. (Statues of Winthrop and Samuel Adams, both by R.S. Greenough, represent Massachusetts in Statuary Hall.) This bronze copy was completed a few years later.

Although the British had won, the Colonial forces had proven themselves a formidable opponent.The monument is a granite obelisk 221 feet high.

Martin Milmore, the better known of the two, created the standing soldier for the Roxbury Soldiers Memorial (also in Forest Hills Cemetery), and the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument, the landmark column with sculptural enhancements, located on the Boston Common. Both monuments set the pattern for many subsequent Civil War monuments. In the Milmore Memorial, Death, represented as a kindly female angel, puts forth a hand to stop the young sculptor’s chisel as he carves a giant sphinx. The sphinx recalls the one carved by the Milmore brothers for Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge. Death and the sculptor are three-dimensional, over life-sized bronze figures placed in front of the bronze sphinx in bas-relief, meaning that the sphinx does not protrude significantly from the background. This masterpiece was created by Daniel Chester French. With it French certainly introduced to America, and may indeed have invented, the sculptural form of placing a free-standing figure before a bas-relief background. He used the form two more times himself, and doubtless influenced other sculptors in its use. The memorial was dedicated in 1893. ","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"Forest Hills Cemetery","full_address":"Forest Hills Cemetery, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.105082,42.294905]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/death.JPG"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"Forest Hills Cemetery","funders":"","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Jamaica Plain","year":"1892"},

Born in Egypt and raised in England, Tucker studied at St. Martin’s College of Art and Design in London, where he encountered some of the foremost sculptors of the modern period, including Anthony Caro, who was on the faculty at the time. Tucker’s early career coincided with the rise of what was to be termed Minimalism, a movement emphasizing linear, geometrical shapes and eschewing emotional expressionism. Minimalist artists often worked with industrial materials, such as steel and plywood, and coated their sculptures in polychrome paint to highlight their simplicity of form and straightforward object-hood. In 1966, Tucker participated in the Primary Structures show in New York, considered the most important exhibition of Minimalist sculpture.From this perspective, then, The Gods seems to be the work of a different individual altogether. After moving to the US in the late 1970s, Tucker gradually began to shift away from hard edges and geometric forms. Works like The Gods have a more organic nature and are even vaguely figural—Ouranus, the middle sculpture, evokes a human foot, while the other two resemble a finger and an inverted horse’s hoof. Gone, too, are the mechanical techniques of Minimalist sculpture: The Gods began as a series of small clay models, shaped by hand. And while Tucker’s early work often featured empty space, these figures are extremely heavy. Curiously, Ouranos, the Greek god of the sky, and his two children are entirely earth-bound.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"University of Massachusetts, Boston, outside the Science Center","full_address":"University of Massachusetts, Boston, outside the Science Center, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.038681,42.313378]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/tucker_gods2.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"Arts on the Point","funders":"","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Dorchester","year":"1969-82"},

The practice of burying loved ones in figurative coffins dates back only about fifty years, when the Sowah family established a carpentry workshop in Accra and launched this unique and fast-growing trend. Families generally request coffins that reflect the trade of their deceased relative; for example, a cobbler might be buried in a giant shoe, a soda distributor in an oversized Coke can. Some designs symbolize interests or prized possessions, such as a car. The lobster coffin, which was likely made to honor a fisherman, illustrates the importance of the sea to Ghanaians as a major source of income and food.

UMass Boston, as the school is known, hosts one of the largest and most important collections of modern sculpture at any American university. Professor of Art Paul Tucker began the sculpture initiative, known as Arts on the Point, in 2000. His mission was twofold: to bring touches of beauty and humanity to the blocky concrete-and-brick campus, and to introduce the local community—students, employees, and inhabitants of South Boston and Dorchester—to works of modern art. Over a dozen pieces are currently installed, many of them on long-term loan from the artists or their estates, who have embraced the opportunity to display their art in what Tucker calls “a truly public environment.” The title of this sculpture means both “hello” and “goodbye” in an aboriginal Australian language. Indeed, although the sculptor, Mark Di Suvero, is generally considered an abstractionist, Huru vaguely evokes the form of a person with arms extended in a gesture of greeting or farewell. A leading creator of assemblage, or junk, sculpture, Di Suvero favored cast-off industrial or construction materials, such as I-beams and scrap metal. These materials, in part, lend his works their linear, angular appearance. Many of Di Suvero’s monumental sculptures are painted in bright colors, but Huru is not, leaving its exposed steel surfaces vulnerable to rust. Huru, then, subtly marks the passage of time and the influence of its environment.Follow this link to watch a short YouTube interview with Professor Paul Tucker:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6MTvd2Ok_g","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"University of Massachusetts, Boston ","full_address":"University of Massachusetts, Boston , Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.042082,42.313782]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/huru3lg.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/huru1lg.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"Arts on the Point","funders":"","medium":"Steel","neighborhood":"Dorchester","year":"1984"},

De Kooning did not begin sculpting until fairly late in his career, but his fascination with the human body, and the challenges of rendering it, remained.What are we to make of the title of this sculpture, \"Reclining Figure?\" The work does seem to hint at anthropomorphic forms—one can identify a protruding limb here, or perhaps a fragment of bone or muscle here—but it’s difficult, if not impossible, to see a complete human body within the mass of metal. Perhaps de Kooning is showing us what a human body might look like if it were torn apart and haphazardly reassembled. The figure’s dissolution contrasts with the strength and durability of the bronze that forms it.  Interestingly, this sculpture began as a small clay cast that de Kooning modeled with his hands. Some of the indentations in the bronze surface resemble thumb imprints, magnified to many times their original size. Thus, the artist’s body lends another layer of physicality to the work.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"University of Massachusetts, Boston, Campus Center/Wheatley Hall","full_address":"University of Massachusetts, Boston, Campus Center/Wheatley Hall, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.037211,42.313259]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/reclining_figure_1.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"Arts on the Point","funders":"","medium":"Bronze","neighborhood":"Dorchester","year":"1969-82"},

It is also the first work to be commissioned for a specific location—the Campus Center, completed in 2004.Although Simple Drawing may be monumental in its scale, its materials appear fragile and its construction tenuous.  The work also defies traditional notions of medium: when a work of art is hanging from a wall, we rarely call it a sculpture, but this work is neither a painting nor a tapestry, although it is made from interwoven fibers.

Jimenez grew up in El Paso, Texas, where his father, a Mexican immigrant, owned a neon sign shop. He passed away suddenly in 2006 after a massive piece of sculpture fell on him while he was working in his studio. Jimenez’s artistic technique and style attests to the longtime influence of his father’s trade, while the subjects he depicts illustrate his continuing fascination with Mexican-American culture and the intermediate space of the border.With his work, Jimenez aims to reach a wide audience of artistic laypeople—not art world initiates and regular museumgoers, but the working class. Naturally, his work has generated controversy, and there are those who find it garish and even insulting. For example, when a version of Steel Worker with the subtitle “Hunky” was shown at a Pittsburgh art festival in 1990, many protested that the epithet and depiction of the worker were degrading.

(They are, of course, painstakingly done by hand.) Here, he gives us a sculpture that wants to be painting—it is two-dimensional, with color privileged over space. But this sculpture also pokes fun at painting, and specifically at the concept of the brushstroke as an existential gesture, the mark of the artist’s identity. With their slick, bright surfaces and clean edges, these brushstrokes appear to be factory-made. In typical fashion, Lichtenstein uses humor and irony to kick fine art off its pedestal.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"University of Massachusetts, Boston, in front of Campus Center","full_address":"University of Massachusetts, Boston, in front of Campus Center, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.035994,42.311868]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Brushstroke_art.JPG"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"Arts on the Point","funders":"Browne Fund","medium":"Painted aluminum","neighborhood":"Dorchester","year":"fabricated 2005"},

Her relentless documentation of the mistreatment of impoverished and mentally ill patients and her tireless lobbying in both Congress and state legislatures led to a revolution in patient care throughout the country. This fountain, however, stands as a testament to Dix’s love of animals. In her will, Dix left five-hundred dollars to the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to provide a drinking fountain for animals, a serious need at a time when Boston’s commerce depended on horse-drawn wagons. The Dix fountain was erected near the Custom House in 1888; it remained in place into the early twentieth century. When the Jenney Building was preserved and renovated and Jenney Park created, the park was given a replica of the original fountain.

In 1829 he made his first public speech against slavery; the following year he founded The Liberator, the influential anti-slavery journal, and was also an organizer of the New England Anti-Slavery Society. The inscription, “I am in earnest – I will not equivocate – I will not excuse – I will not retreat a single inch – AND I WILL BE HEARD,” is from Garrison’s first issue of The Liberator, and is followed by the sentence, “The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal, and to hasten the resurrection of the dead.” As if in response to this, sculptor Olin Levi Warner depicted Garrison in a state somewhere between relaxation and restlessness, clutching a piece of paper and staring intently into the distance, as if to rise from his chair and stride forth. Books and papers scattered beneath the chair add to the sense of activity, and refer to Garrison’s fierce intellectual reputation.  ","discipline":"Statue","location_description":"Commonwealth Ave.","full_address":"Commonwealth Ave., Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.078574,42.350235]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/William%20Lloyd%20Garrison,%20Levi%20Warner%20(1).JPG","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/William%20Lloyd%20Garrison,%20Levi%20Warner%20(7).JPG"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"1886"},

The women are Abigail Adams, Phillis Wheatley, and Lucy Stone. All three of them sought education and achieved it to a level not only remarkable for women but for anyone of their times. All three women became writers and are now known to us through their writings. Sculptor Meredith Bergmann represents each woman by placing her statue beside inscriptions of her work.Abigail Adams (1744-1818) was the wife of John Adams, second president of the United States. The couple exchanged hundreds of letters in which Abigail argued for a woman’s right to be educated, to own and manage her own property, and to be a participant in the making of any law affecting women. Phillis Wheatley (1753-1784) began her life in America as a slave. She was taken from her home in Gambia, Senegal, at the age of seven, and was purchased by the Wheatley family of Boston to be a lady’s maid. The family taught her to read and write and gave her access to the family library. Wheatley became a poet, and in 1773 she became the first African-American writer to be published. Lucy Stone (1818-1893)was the first Massachusetts woman to graduate from college—Oberlin in 1847. She was an able public speaker and pioneered in resisting the convention that women should not be allowed to address audiences that contained men. She began her career as a lecturer for the abolition of slavery, but soon saw that the rights of women needed as much defending as the rights of slaves. When slavery was abolished, Stone continued her career by speaking and writing on behalf of women’s rights. Stone and her husband, Henry Blackwell, showed their dedication to a married woman’s retaining her rights to her person and her property, by incorporating a “Marriage Protest” in their wedding ceremony, a document that was given wide circulation. Once married, Stone fought for a married woman’s right to maintain her own identity, by regularly insisting that she be known as “Lucy Stone” rather than “Mrs. Blackwell,” an insistence that led to regular clashes with public officials.The Women’s Memorial was commissioned by the City of Boston, and dedicated in 2003.","discipline":"Sculpture","location_description":"","full_address":", Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.08334,42.350487]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Boston%20Women's%20Memorial,%20Bergmann%20(3).jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Boston%20Women's%20Memorial,%20Bergmann%20(2).jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Boston%20Women's%20Memorial,%20Bergmann%20(4).jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"City of Boston","medium":"Bronze and Granite","neighborhood":"Back Bay","year":"2003"},

By holding the hill, the Colonists threatened the British occupation of the city. On June 17, 1775 - the day of the so-called “Battle of Bunker Hill”- the British were determined to dislodge the Colonists with a frontal attack. The Colonists withstood two British charges, but their resistance to a third charge was weakened by a shortage of powder and shot. This ill-timed lack of artillery ultimately lead to the British forces reaching the top of the hill. This painting, created by Dennis Malone Carter, is the artist’s imaginative reconstruction of that dramatic moment. While the hand-to-hand combat that he illustrates probably did give some of the Colonists time to escape, the painting’s title hardly does justice to the grand scene of clashing armies on the day.

He is depicted here with his hand outstretched in an oratorical gesture that emphasizes his skill as a wordsmith. In his day, his skill at making speeches was only surpassed by President Abraham Lincoln. (Everett himself once admitted that his two hour speech at the dedication of the national cemetery on the Gettysburg battlefield was trumped by Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, which only lasted two minutes.) Everett was born in Dorchester and attended Harvard College; he went to Europe for further study following his graduation, making him the first American to earn a doctorate from a German university. He held an impressive range of private and public offices, including: minister of the Brattle Street Church in Boston; Harvard Professor of Greek; member of the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts; Governor of Massachusetts; Ambassador to Great Britain; President of Harvard, and United States Senator from Massachusetts. Everett’s portrait, by Moses Wright (1827-1895), illustrates Everett surrounded by symbols of government and learning. The Greek columns in the background give the painting a strong Classical sensibility, connecting the democracy of ancient Greece with that of America. Additionally, the columns are visually echoed by Everett’s solid, upright form, and contrasted against the billowing red drapery that frames the composition. The inkwell by Everett’s right hand further accentuates his intellectual ferocity. The portrait currently can be found in Faneuil Hall. ","discipline":"Painting","location_description":"Faneuil Hall","full_address":"Faneuil Hall, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.056223,42.360066]},"image_urls":[],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"","medium":"Oil on Canvas","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"Unknown"},

This unknown painter, however, made some interesting changes to the composition; in Copley’s depiction, Warren is presented as a gentleman of wealth and luxury, surrounded by elegant pink drapery and a grand granite column, wearing silk stockings, ruffled sleeves, and a jacket with embroidered buttons. In contrast, the painter of this Faneuil Hall portrait crops the composition, only showing us Warren’s casually opened waistcoat and his subdued black clothes. Furthermore, the Faneuil Hall portrait omits the glimpse of landscape Copley provides in his original work, giving this painting a more intimate, inner focus. The emphasis here is on Warren’s psychological state as opposed to the signifiers of his success. However, this could be an entirely accidental effect - Copley was renowned for his ability to render texture and detail and this painter simply may not have possessed the skill to depict the many accoutrements Copley showcased in his original work.","discipline":"Painting","location_description":"Faneuil Hall","full_address":"Faneuil Hall, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.056223,42.36009]},"image_urls":[],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"","medium":"Oil on Canvas","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"Unknown"},

He later entered politics, where he was recognized as an able statesman who was careful to acquaint himself with public opinion and, as such, was an early campaigner for emancipation. However, he also championed less popular causes such as voting and civil rights for the freed slaves, women’s rights, temperance, and educational reform. This portrait of Wilson was painted by Nahum Ball Onthank (1823-1888), a self-taught artist who also painted portraits of United States Senator Charles Sumner, Revolutionary leader Samuel Adams, and abolitionist John Brown. In this painting, Onthank depicts Wilson in very conservative attire, with a stiff upturned collar and a simple necktie. His somber clothing nearly fades into the background, and he is framed by books and letters - perhaps a reference to his many published works on slavery and emancipation. Unlike more lavish portraits of European aristocracy, depictions of American politicians and patriots tended to be more reserved and austere, a testament to the colonial values that shaped the country.","discipline":"Painting","location_description":"Faneuil Hall","full_address":"Faneuil Hall, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.056244,42.360066]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/Henry%20Wilson,%20Onthank.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"","medium":"Oil on Canvas","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"Unknown"},

The subject of the painting, John Hancock (1737-1792), was born in Braintree and inherited his uncle’s shipping business. At a relatively young age, Hancock became one of the wealthiest men in New England. With his newfound status as a member of the upper class, Hancock became a leading political figure in the Revolutionary War, using his wealth to fund the colonial resistance to British rule. In this portrait, Hancock sports a gold-trimmed coat and waistcoat, silk stockings, ruffled sleeves, and powdered wig - all signifiers of his wealth and high societal standing. The lush silk drapery that frames the composition adds to the impression of prosperity and is a nod toward Hancock’s taste for the extravagant. However, despite all of this finery, Hancock is shown entering information into a business ledger, as if to remind viewers of his skill as a man of industry. The original portrait was painted nearly ten years before 1776, but the quill Hancock holds in his right hand serves as a subtle nod to viewers today of his famously elaborate signature on the Declaration of Independence.","discipline":"Painting","location_description":"Faneuil Hall","full_address":"Faneuil Hall, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.056266,42.360066]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/John%20Hancock,%20unknown%20copy%20from%20Copley%20original.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"","medium":"Oil on Canvas","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1876"},

A prominent politician himself, John Quincy Adams followed in his father's footsteps and had a long and brilliant career in government, serving in the United States Senate, as Minister to Russia and to England, and as Secretary of State under James Monroe. In 1825, he was elected the sixth President of the United States, where he served a single term. After losing his bid for re-election, Adams spent the rest of his life as the Congressional representative of Plymouth, Massachusetts, where he continued his life-long defense of civil liberties.This portrait is by Horace Robbins Burdick (1844-1942), after an original by William Page (1811-1885). The original Page portrait was painted from life in 1838, when Adams was seventy-one. Page's painting used to hang in Faneuil Hall, but was moved to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1876 over concerns that the painting could be damaged in a fire - a real threat at the time, as the interior of Faneuil Hall was entirely wooden and had been nearly demolished in a fire in 1761. This copy, by Burdick, was commissioned in 1876 to hang in its place and shows Adams seated in a low-backed chair, the patterned arms of which serve as the only hint of decorative indulgence.Adams was an avid sitter for portraits and was the subject of many leading portraitists of the time, including John Singleton Copley, who captured a younger Adams as his political career was first gaining momentum. Here, nearing the end of his life, Adams is portrayed as somewhat relaxed and contemplative, but still very active in contemporary life, as indicated by his fashionable dark cravat worn with a wide turn-over collar. The Federal-style building in the background is a reminder of his long years of public service in politics, both local and international.","discipline":"Painting","location_description":"Faneuil Hall","full_address":"Faneuil Hall, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.056244,42.360082]},"image_urls":[],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"","medium":"Oil on Canvas","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1876"},

He was born in New Rochelle, New York, and moved to Boston as a young man to join his uncle in the shipping business, which he eventually inherited. While Faneuil had a reputation for living well, he was also known as a considerate employer and a generous public benefactor. In 1740, he offered to build Boston a public market house; it was finished a few months before his death and was subsequently named “Faneuil Hall” in his honor. John Smibert (1688-1751), Faneuil Hall’s first architect, painted a posthumous portrait of Peter Faneuil to be hung in the original hall. This painting was damaged in the great fire of  1761, but was rehung in the next incarnation of the hall. This particular painting had another run of poor luck when it was further damaged in a 1775 demonstation by patriots against members of the Faneuil family - who had lost much of their popularity when they joined the British evacuation of Boston. Smibert’s portrait of Peter Faneuil was then copied by Henry Sargent (1770-1845) in 1807, in order to preserve the likeness of the deteriorating original. This is the painting that is displayed today, a gift to Faneuil Hall by Samuel Parkman.","discipline":"Painting","location_description":"Faneuil Hall","full_address":"Faneuil Hall, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.056191,42.360098]},"image_urls":[],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"","funders":"","medium":"Oil on Canvas","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"1807"},

Images will be visible on the building's three stories-high, seven window bays-wide architecturally scaled art installation. Each artists’ work will run in 15 minute blocks. The program will run nightly beginning 2 hours before sunset and ending at midnight. It is anticipated that the contributed work will change periodically, featuring a rotating roster of artists.According to Ketner, “The intention is to activate the visual dynamics of Washington Street and the Theatre District neighborhood with something a little different—a monumental artistic experience.” Read more at ArtsEmerson Online.","discipline":"light installation","location_description":"on the façade of 559 Washington Street","full_address":"on the façade of 559 Washington Street, Boston, MA","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.06266,42.353547]},"image_urls":["http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/LED%20wall%206.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/LED%201.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/LED%202.jpg","http://www.publicartboston.com/sites/default/files/node_images/LED%203.jpg"],"data_source":"Boston Art Commission","doc_type":"artwork","collection":"Emerson","funders":"ArtsEmerson","medium":"LED lights","neighborhood":"Downtown","year":"2011"}
